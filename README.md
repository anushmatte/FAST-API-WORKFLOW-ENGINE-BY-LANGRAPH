# FAST-API-WORKFLOW-ENGINE-BY-LANGRAPH
Quantum Workflow Backend is an extensible workflow engine built with FastAPI. It lets you define directed node-graphs (workflows), register processing nodes (functions that transform a run state), start runs via a REST API, and observe execution results . The included example code_review_v1 graph analyzes submitted source code for simple issues .

# Quantum Workflow Backend

A lightweight, extensible **workflow engine** built using **FastAPI**.  
This backend allows you to define *graphs of processing nodes*, execute them as workflows, log every step, and retrieve the results via REST APIs.

The project includes a fully functional example workflow:  
**`code_review_v1`** — a simple code-analysis pipeline that:
- extracts functions from source code,
- checks complexity,
- detects basic issues,
- generates quality suggestions.
